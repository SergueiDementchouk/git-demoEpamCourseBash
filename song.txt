Zero

I find it hard to say the things I want to say the most
Find a little bit of steady as I get close
Find a balance in the middle of the chaos
Send me low, send me high, send me never demigod
I remember walking in the cold of November
Hoping that I make it to the end of December
27 years and the end of my mind
But holding to the thought of another time
But looking to the ways at the ones before me
Looking for the path of the young and lonely
I don't want to hear about what to do
I donï¿½t want to do it just to do it for you
